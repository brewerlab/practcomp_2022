## BLOCKQUOTES

_The Way We Were_ by G.A. Parker

> A sweet and friendly porcupine, \
> Snuffled up; his eyes met mine, \
> I pickled him in bright red wine, \
> And labelled each and every spine.

> A thousand more I then did nail, \
> and measured all from head to tail, \
> and plotted on a log/log scale, \
> ... but everything to no avail.

> An orgy of regression failed -- \
> So algebra I then assailed, \
> With all the fun that this entailed \
> I modelled ... and results prevailed.

> My future now was quite secure, \
> And to the field I go no more, \
> Papers, papers by the score \
> Full of sums and such a bore.
